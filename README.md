##Snark Overflow
---------------------

##Introduction
---------------------
SNark Overflow is a site where one can aquire completely unhelpful commentary on their current projects! We try to cultivate an environment of argumentative posturing, with very little meaningful work being done.

##Requirements
---------------------
To run this you need Ruby on Rails 4 and Postgres installed on your server!

##Instructions
---------------------
CD into the SnarkOverflow directory and run the following commands:

```
$ bundle
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:test:prepare
$ rails server
```
Now open a browser and go to localhost:3000 and you are blogging in style, my friend!
